## Irish times

There are three steps: 

1. Construct query
1. Test that query works
1. Get the result of the query into R and extract information you want from it.

### Construct query

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
base <- "http://fedsearch.proquest.com/search/sru/"

# I can't use Irish times, instead I'll use globalwires
db <- "globalwires"

operation <- "?operation=searchRetrieve&version=1.2&maximumRecords=30&startRecord=1"

query_stub <- "&query=title%3D%22"

query_string <- "economic uncertainty"

query_string <- URLencode(query_string)

query <- str_c(query_stub, query_string)

all_together <- str_c(base, db, operation, query)

all_together
```

### Test that query works

Now the URL in a browser should return a page that looks like this: 

```{r, fig.cap="Screenshot of WSJ query in browser"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/j-jayes/irish-uncertainty/main/images/html_return_wsj.PNG")
```

The image above is from my browser, when I paste in the URL from all_together into my browser.

### Get the result of the query into R

To read this HTML into R, you can use the rvest package and the `read_html` command.

#### Using HTML and rvest

```{r}
library(rvest)
html <-read_html(all_together)

html
```

This html document can be parsed with the `rvest` package where you choose the elements of the list you want with `html_elements`. 

```{r}
html %>% 
    html_elements('[tag="245"]') %>% 
    html_text() %>% 
    as_tibble() %>% 
    rename(title = value)
```

#### Using XML and the listviewer package.

Alternatively you can use XML 

```{r}
library(XML)

xml <- XML::xmlParse(all_together)

list <- xml %>% 
    XML::xmlToList(simplify = T)

listviewer::jsonedit(list)
```

You then need to fiddle with the pluck command to get out the information you want into a dataframe. See the  guide from Thomas Mock:

<blockquote>

This guide from [Thomas Mock](https://themockup.blog/posts/2020-05-22-parsing-json-in-r-with-jsonlite/) is super useful on how to parse the lists we get back and how to view them in R. Look towards the bottom of the post where he uses the [**purrr** package](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/).

</blockquote>

```{r}
pluck(list, "records", 2, "recordData", "record") %>% 
    # this command is great! wow!
    enframe() %>% 
    filter(name == "datafield") %>% 
    unnest_wider(value) %>% 
    select(subfield) %>% 
    unnest(subfield) %>% 
    unnest_wider(subfield)
```
